# Aurelia VueX

An experiment in creating bindings in Aurelia for using VueX.

## What?

VueX is the state management library for Vue applications. It offers a simplistic API for adding in state management to Vue applications. But, VueX was built with Vue in mind and not for anything else.

## What this plugin does

It binds into VueX and allows you to use VueX state management inside of an Aurelia application. It basically wraps VueX.
